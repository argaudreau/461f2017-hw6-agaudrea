# Adam Gaudreau's GUI1 HW6
This repository contains my homework 6 submission.

## Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to build off of the assignment in HW5, located [here](https://github.com/argaudreau/461f2017-hw5-agaudrea), except use the JQueryUI to enhance some features of the page.

## "Impress Me"
Here's some things I did that are supplementary:
* There is one slider per axis, as opposed to having an individual one per input field. This makes sense since it is a min-max relationship.
* There are default values for each variable in the axis. This makes it so the user can see a table near instantly if they wanted to.
* You can submit and edit each tab individually. A table can be displayed on Tab 1, for example, while in Tab 3 you are editing the form.
* Used a modal for deleting multiple tabs at once.
